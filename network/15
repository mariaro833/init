# Make the intra.42.fr address reroute to 46.19.122.85
# If you had root access, you can edit the file via
# sudo vim /etc/hosts. In practice, however, this is not possible, because
# we don't have the permissions to change it on a school iMac
# Then enter the below line to reroute:
# 46.19.122.85	intra.42.fr
# And to  confirm by running
# traceroute intra.42.fr
