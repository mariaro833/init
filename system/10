lsblk

# sudo fdisk -l

# lsblk lists information about all available or specified block device.
# dev/sda shows up as sda and is the main disk drive. It may then have
# partitions as sda1, sda2 ... sda5 etc.
# The "sd" in sda originally identifies a SCSI (Smalll Computer System Interface) device.
# It's now a catch-all for any block device, ever since the proliferation of USB and other
# removable data carriers.
# The "a" signifies the order in which the drive is first found -- a, b, c...z, Aa...Az etc.
# The numbers after sda..sdz etc. signify the partition on the device.
# sudo fdisk -l will show more details of the DOS partitioning.
# You will notice a primary partition, usually starting as sda1. A traditional partition table
# will have a maximum of four primary partitions.
# There is also an extended partition (in my case, sda2 which starts out as 1K size). This
# is a workaround to the max 4 partition limit. It's a container for logical partitions,
# which allows one to extend the maximum number of drives limitation).
# The SWAP partition (in my case, sda5), serves as an extension of RAM. Used as
# virtual memory when the system runs out of physical memory. Swapping occurs when a
# running process requires mroe RAM than there is available. Since the hard-drive memory
# is much slower, some degree of prioritisation occurs when considering what processes are moved to SWAP.
