sudo du -shc /var/*/

#  Figure out the exact size of each folder of /var in a humanly un# derstandable way followed by the path of it

# man du: estimate file space usage. Disk space used.
# -h: human-readable
# -s: summarize: display only a total for each argument
# -c: grand total of sizes
# in order to not list the size of all files, and only show the summary of
# folder sizes in /var we use -s. That would also need the argument to be
# /var/*, otherwise it only shows the size of /var
