1. in the graphical interface:
Log out if necessary, click on the user you want to log in as,
and type your password.

2. via ssh:
For example, on my mac, I would open iTerm and type

ssh somebody@[my ip "ip a"] -p 2222 

# there -p specifies the Host port that I've specified in Port Forwarding
# over at the Debian Virtual Machine settings, and testuser is the user
# I want to connect to.
