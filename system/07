cat /var/run/sshd.pid

# Figure out the PID of the SSHD service
# PID stands for Process Identification number. So it fails terribly as an acronym.
# sudo service ssh status | grep PID | cut -d ":" -f2 | cut -d " " -f2
# pidof sshd
# or
# ps aux | grep "/usr/sbin/sshd" | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}'
# ps aux will show all the processes running for all users
# grep "/usr/sbin/sshd" shows the sshd process from the outputs
# Sometimes the grep process will also show up, so grep -v grep makes sure that only the sshd
# process is searched
# the PID is the second element from awk
